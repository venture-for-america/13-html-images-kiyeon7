# HTML Images

## Overview

In this lesson we will do a quick review of HTML images from the video lecture in the prior lesson.

## What's Covered in This Lesson 

1. HTML `<img>` element
2. HTML `alt` attribute
3. HTML `title` attribute

### Images

```html
<img src="myimage.jpg" alt="Alternate text" title="Display title on hover.">
```

Image elements `<img>` allow us to link to an image and display it in the browser. The `src` attribute is where we provide the path to our image file. The `alt` attribute is where we provide alternate text for the visually impaired. (The `alt` attribute is also good for search engines.) The `title` attribute allows us to type a phrase that will appear as the user hovers of the image for a period of time.

## Summary

- HTML images can be defined as `<img src="myimage.jpg" alt="alternate text">`.
